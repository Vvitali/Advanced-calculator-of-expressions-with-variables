# Advanced calculator of expressions with variables

Software project in C language: calculation of expressions ( Arithmetic: + - * /) with numbers and variables. Full execution and step-by-step tracing. Based on "Shunting-yard algorithm" with reverse polish notation. Program reads expressions, and variables from user-defined text-file, and write results to another user-defined text-file. Project has a text user interface with box-drawing character. 

Program will ask you 2 things:
1) Input file: you can use standart text files (*.txt, or just *)
2) Output file: you can use any names what you want.

Also you have to choose execution mode:
1) Full execution - here you will see just a result of expression.
2) Tracing mode - in this case program will show you step-by-step process with intermediate results and values of variables.
